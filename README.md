‚ö†Ô∏è **Power Note**: This wiring is suitable for short-term demo purposes only. For production use, consider external power supply for servos.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Software Requirements:**
- **Node.js** (v16 or later) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **VS Code** with PlatformIO extension - [Get VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) - [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Git** - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Hardware Requirements:**
- ESP32 development board
- 3x servo motors (miuzei ms18 micro 9g or similar)
- USB cable for programming
- Jumper wires

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ESP32-Rehab-Hand-Exoskeleton.git
cd ESP32-Rehab-Hand-Exoskeleton
```

## Software Setup

### ESP32 Firmware

1. **Install PlatformIO**:
   - Install VS Code
   - Install PlatformIO extension

2. **Build and Upload**:
   ```bash
   # From the project root directory
   pio run --target upload
   pio device monitor
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   === ESP32 Servo Controller Starting ===
   Initializing servos...
   Initializing BLE...
   BLE advertising started
   === Setup Complete ===
   Waiting for BLE connections...
   ```

### Mobile App

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ServoController
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   # Build release APK for Android (Expo will handle everything)
   npx expo run:android --variant release
   ```

   **Note**: First run will take longer as Expo downloads Android SDK components and builds the project.

3. **Connection Process**:
   - If ESP32 was previously paired, forget it in Android Bluetooth settings
   - Open the mobile app
   - Tap "üì° Scan for ESP32"
   - Once connected, use the control buttons

## üê≥ **Docker Infrastructure**

This project includes a complete backend infrastructure using Docker containers for professional data logging and monitoring:

- **ü¶ü Mosquitto MQTT Broker**: Handles real-time data communication from ESP32
- **üóÑÔ∏è MariaDB Database**: Stores therapy sessions, movement data, and system logs
- **üåê Web Dashboard**: Browser-based interface for data visualization and monitoring
- **üîß phpMyAdmin**: Database management interface for development

The Docker setup provides:
- **Real-time data logging** from ESP32 via WiFi/MQTT
- **Professional web interface** accessible from any browser
- **Comprehensive session tracking** and progress monitoring
- **Scalable architecture** ready for multiple devices

**üìã Quick Setup**: Deploy all services with a single `docker-compose up -d` command.

**üìñ Detailed Instructions**: See [Server Setup Guide](SERVER_SETUP.md) for complete installation and configuration steps.

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

### Control Modes

- **üîÑ Run Servo Test**: Test individual servo with 3x 90¬∞ movements
- **üìã Sequential Movement**: Servos move one at a time (3 cycles)
- **‚ö° Simultaneous Movement**: All servos move together (3 cycles)
- **‚èπÔ∏è Stop All Servos**: Return to idle state (0¬∞ position)

### Mobile App Features

1. **Connection**: Tap "üì° Scan for ESP32" to find and connect
2. **Control**: Use the control buttons to trigger movements
3. **Status**: Real-time connection status and command feedback
4. **Debug**: "üîç Debug Info" button for troubleshooting

### üì° BLE Communication Protocol

- **Service UUID**: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
- **Characteristic UUID**: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`
- **Commands**:
  - `"TEST"` - Run servo test
  - `"0"` - Stop/idle state
  - `"1"` - Sequential movement
  - `"2"` - Simultaneous movement
- **Responses**:
  - `STATE_CHANGED:X` - Command acknowledged
  - `TEST_COMPLETE` - Test sequence finished

## Power Management Features

- **Staggered Movements**: Reduces peak current draw
- **Interruptible Sequences**: Immediate response to new commands
- **Recovery Delays**: Prevents servo overheating
- **Single-Core Servo Task**: Dedicated FreeRTOS task for servo control

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Can't Find ESP32**:
  - Ensure ESP32 is powered and shows "BLE advertising started"
  - Forget previous Bluetooth pairings in Android settings
  - Grant all Bluetooth permissions to the app
- **Connection Drops**:
  - Check power supply stability
  - Restart both ESP32 and mobile app
  - Use "üîç Debug Info" to check connection state

### Hardware Issues
- **Servos Not Moving**:
  - Verify wiring connections (GPIO 18, 19, 21)
  - Check power supply (USB 3.0 recommended)
  - Monitor serial output for error messages
- **Jerky Movement**:
  - Insufficient power - try powered USB hub
  - Check servo connections

### App Issues
- **Buttons Not Working**:
  - Ensure proper BLE connection established
  - Check console logs for error messages
  - Try "üîÑ Run Servo Test" first to verify connection
